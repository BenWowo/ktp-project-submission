This application uses pocketbase to locally host the database
as well as streamlit locally host the frontend service

The applications are port forwarded through docker
so if you click the links in the logs they will not work

Instead visit these domains to view the application
view the frontend at localhost:8200
view the database admin console at localhost:8100/_/
The username and password are `admin@gmail.com` and `password123`
